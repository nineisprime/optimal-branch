optimal-branch
==============

A light-weight implementation of Edmond's Algorithm in C++. The alternative implementation uses the Boost Graph Library, which can be cumbersome to use. This version is fully self-contained and contains code that interfaces with MATLAB. 

Edmond's algorithm finds a directed graph with the minimum directed edge weights; it can be understood as a directed version of the minimum spanning tree algorithm. 

This implementation is based on RE Tarjan's refinement of Edmond's original algorithm.
